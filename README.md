Vue SPA for sharing simple workouts with visual instructions for exercises.

The goal is to make it easy for exercise instructors to provide simple exercise programs to their clients' mobile devices.

Users can contribute to a private and collective exercise database(Mongo), then use the exercises to build workout programs
to share with their clients/followers. Exercises consist of minimal data and instructions are entirely image and gif based (S3).
Workouts can be set to timers to pace users during their exercise in absence of their trainer.

It's been hard to limit this to an MVP because of it's potential to turn into a social network and include gamification.
